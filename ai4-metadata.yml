title: Cold coral segmentation
summary: "Cold corals segmentation model"
description: |-
  Cold corals segmentation model: 
  This AI-powered segmentation model, based on YOLOv8, is designed to accurately detect and segment two vital cold-water coral species: *Desmophyllum pertusum* and *Madrepora oculata*.
  The model was developed by COST (IEO-CSIC).
